Bindery is a cross-platform solution to DIY book digitalization, all written in Python. In order to make it useable to non-techies or Terminal-phobics, a GUI exists and is written in PyQt4. The core of the software is the djvubind package, which is basically the CLI father of the whole project.

Who?
____
My nickname is Blender. I prefer to stay (partially) anonymous, but my real identity can be determined quite easily.

What?
_____
As mentioned earlier, Bindery is a cross-platform solution to DIY book digitalization, all written in Python. In order to make it useable to non-techies or Terminal-phobics, a GUI exists and is written in PyQt4. The core of the software is the djvubind package, which is basically the CLI father of the whole project.

When?
_____
The first git commit was performed on Saturday January 1, 2011, but the project was spread around my desktop for a few days beforehand.

Where?
______
In the inner workings of my mind, the hard drive I work with, and a lot of help from GitHub!

Why?
____
This project was created mainly because I was bored, but helping the DIY book scanning community grow is a part of it too.

How?
____
It's written in Python. I love Python. I can rant on about that topic endlessly, but this is not what you want to hear (I hope), so it's better not to ask.
