        <dt>Who?</dt>
        
        <dd>My nickname is Blender. I prefer to stay (partially) anonymous, but my real identity can be determined quite easily.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>What?</dt>
        
        <dd>As mentioned earlier, Bindery is a cross-platform solution to DIY book digitalization, all written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. In order to make it useable to non-techies or Terminal-phobics, a GUI exists and is written in <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt4</a>. The core of the software is the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/djvubind/">djvubind</a> package, which is basically the CLI father of the whole project.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>When?</dt>
        
        <dd>The first git commit was performed on Saturday January 1, 2011, but the project was spread around my desktop for a few days beforehand.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>Where?</dt>
        
        <dd>In the inner workings of my mind, the hard drive I work with, and a lot of help from <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>!</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>Why?</dt>
        
        <dd>This project was created mainly because I was bored, but helping the DIY book scanning community grow is a part of it too.</dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>How?</dt>
        
        <dd>It's written in Python. I love Python. I can rant on about that topic endlessly, but this is not what you want to hear (I hope), so it's better not to ask.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    
    <div id="develop">
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>So you want to help, huh?</dt>
        
        <dd>Well then, welcome aboard! Just email me at <a href="mailto:"></a>, convince me you're not going to screw up the project, and I'll give you write access to the git repository.</dd>

      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>Using Git</dt>
        
        <dd>
          <p>Well, since I've been ranting on so much about the project, I'll neglected to let you see it for yourself.</p>
          
          <p>I use a version control system called <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to manage my code, since I edit it so often and I'm too lazy to tarball it every time.</p>
          
          <p>To git the code, you need the git version control client. It's command-line, so don't be shocked when you don't get your fancy Start Menu shortcut after you install it. Run this in Terminal or the alike program to check out the source:</p>
          
          <code>git clone git://github.com/Blender3D/Bindery.git</code>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>Not using Git</dt>
        
        <dd>
          <p>For those who can't or don't want to use git, GitHub allows you to download a tarball of the current snapshot of the source code. Here's the link to the current snapshot (it's a hot one): <a href="https://github.com/Blender3D/Bindery/tarball/master">https://github.com/Blender3D/Bindery/tarball/master</a>.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      
      <dl class="nodates">
        <dt>Some screenshots</dt>
        
        <dd>
          As some people like to see what they are downloading, here are a few screenshots:
          
          <img src="screenshot1.png" />
          <img src="screenshot2.png" />
          
          These could be out of date, but the GUI shouldn't change <i>too</i> drastically (but it might).
