djvubind

========
Dependencies

python3
djvulibre
imagemagick
tesseract

You could forgo having tesseract installed so long as you always use the --no-ocr option.

========
Recommendations

minidjvu
cuneiform

Minidjvu will get better compression on bitonal images than cjb2 (part of djvulibre)
currently can.  Some say that cuneiform is a better ocr engine, but in my experience it
has issues with buffer overflows.  If it crashes, tesseract will take over for that image.

========
Installation

Installation should be as simple as "./setup.py install" on Unix based systems.  You can
add --dry-run if you want to check what will happen before doing it, or just use --help
for all the details on options.  Those with debian based distros will probably be
insterest in --install-layout=deb.

Installation is not necessary, since djvubind can run straight from the unpacked source.
This is actually preferred in a Windows environment

N.b., at the moment most distributions are able to have python3 installed but do
not use that version by default.  If this is the case (and it probably is),
explicitly call python3 when installing (e.g. "python3 ./setup.py install")

========
Usage

Run djvubind in a directory that contains the files that should combined into the
djvu file.  Only files with .tif or .tiff extension will be included in the file.
Additionally, by default "bookmarks" and "metadata" files will be inserted if they
are present; they should be in the format used by djvused for print-outline and
print-meta.  A front or back cover image can also be provided in jpeg or tiff
formats.

An example directory:

cover_front.jpg
cover_back.jpg
bookmarks
metadata
page_0001.tif
page_0002.tif
...
page_n.tif

---
An example bookmarks file:

(bookmarks
 ("Cover" "#1" )
 ("Contents" "#7" )
)

Note the # symbol before the page number, and don't forget that if you have a cover
image, that will be page 1.

An example metadata file:

author "John Smith"
title "Creating Quality Documents"
